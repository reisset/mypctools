# Nick's Claude Code Preferences

## Communication
- Be concise. Skip the preamble.
- If I ask a question, answer it directly first, then elaborate if needed.
- Don't over-explain unless I ask "why" or "how does this work".

## My Project Style
- I build small, self-contained tools: bash installers, Python webapps, dotfiles
- I prefer single-file scripts when possible
- If a project needs multiple files, keep the structure flat and obvious

## Code Preferences
- Comments only where the code isn't self-explanatory
- For scripts: include a version/changelog comment block at the top
- Use descriptive variable names over comments
- Error handling: fail loudly with clear messages

## Workflow
- I usually start in plan mode - interview me to understand what I want
- Help me scaffold first, then I'll test and debug
- When I report a bug, focus on fixing it, not refactoring unrelated code

## Things I Don't Like
- Over-engineered solutions for simple problems
- Creating extra files when one would do
- Verbose explanations when I just need the answer
